# TP-Dailyrewards
This is a unique daily rewards script for your players with many features and optimizations in order to receive daily rewards.

Features:

    Battlepass Leveling System works with playtime which is also configurable if you want to increase level requirement after every level (All levels are having 300 minutes as playtime as default).

    Supports Multicharacters.

    Level rewards, such as items, weapons, money, black_money, bank.

    Custom reward packages (Optionable). That means, if you want to give multiple items, money or anything at the same time in a level reward, you can create a pack in Config.levelRewardPacks called for example “clips” and add this pack as a reward type in order to give multiple items (in this pack i would give all magazine types).

    Some basic images are included (Suggested images size is: 128 x 91 | 128 x 128), otherwise displaying images will not be correct.
