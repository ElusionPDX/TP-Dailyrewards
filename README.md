# TP-Dailyrewards
This is a unique daily rewards script for your players with many features and optimizations in order to receive daily rewards.

Features:

- Battlepass Leveling System works with playtime which is also configurable if you want to increase level requirement after every level (All levels are having 300 minutes as playtime as default).

- Supports Multicharacters.

- Daily rewards, such as items, weapons, money, black_money, bank including custom packages, That means, if you want to give multiple items, money or anything at the same time in a daily pack reward, you can create a pack in Config.RewardPacks called for example “clips” and add this pack as a reward type in order to give multiple items (in this pack i would give all magazine types).


- Some basic images are included (Suggested images size is: 128 x 91 | 128 x 128), otherwise displaying images will not be correct.

Commands:

- /dailyrewards - Allows you to open dailyrewards.

Make sure before starting the script to change the items in the config
